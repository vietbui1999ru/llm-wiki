## Context Editing & Memory for Long-Running Agents

AI agents that run across multiple sessions or handle long-running tasks face two key challenges: they lose learned patterns between conversations, and context windows fill up during extended interactions.

This cookbook demonstrates how to address these challenges using Claude's memory tool and context editing capabilities.

## Prerequisites

**Required Knowledge:**

- Python fundamentals (functions, classes, async/await basics)
- Basic understanding of REST APIs and JSON

**Required Tools:**

- Python 3.10 or higher
- Anthropic API key ([get one here](https://console.anthropic.com/))

**Recommended:**

- Familiarity with concurrent programming concepts (threads, async)
- Basic understanding of context windows in LLMs

## Setup

### For VSCode Users

```bash
# 1. Create virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
 
# 2. Activate it
source .venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
# or: .venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
 
# 3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
 
# 4. In VSCode: Select .venv as kernel (top right)
```

## 1\. Introduction: Why Memory Matters

This cookbook demonstrates practical implementations of the context engineering patterns described in [Effective context engineering for AI agents](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/effective-context-engineering-for-ai-agents). That post covers why context is a finite resource, how attention budgets work, and strategies for building effective agents—the techniques you'll see in action here.

### The Problem

Large language models have finite context windows (200k tokens for the Claude 4 family of models). While this seems large, several challenges emerge:

- **Context limits**: Long conversations or complex tasks can exceed available context
- **Computational cost**: Processing large contexts is expensive - attention mechanisms scale quadratically
- **Repeated patterns**: Similar tasks across conversations require re-explaining context every time
- **Information loss**: When context fills up, earlier important information gets lost

### The Solution

Claude 4 models introduce powerful context management capabilities:

1. **Memory Tool** (`memory_20250818`): Enables cross-conversation learning
	- Claude can write down what it learns for future reference
		- File-based system under `/memories` directory
		- Client-side implementation gives you full control
2. **Context Editing**: Automatically manages context with two strategies:
	- **Tool use clearing** (`clear_tool_uses_20250919`): Clears old tool results when context grows large
		- **Thinking management** (`clear_thinking_20251015`): Manages extended thinking blocks (requires thinking enabled)
		- Configurable triggers and retention policies

### The Benefit

Build AI agents that **get better at your specific tasks over time**:

- **Session 1**: Claude solves a problem, writes down the pattern
- **Session 2**: Claude applies the learned pattern immediately (faster!)
- **Long sessions**: Context editing keeps conversations manageable

Think of it as giving Claude a notebook to take notes and refer back to - just like humans do.

### What You'll Learn

By the end of this cookbook, you will be able to:

- **Implement** the memory tool for cross-conversation learning
- **Configure** context editing to manage long-running sessions
- **Apply** best practices for memory security and organization

**This cookbook focuses on the Code Review Assistant** as it clearly demonstrates both memory (learning patterns) and context editing (handling long reviews).

## 3\. Quick Start Examples

Let's see memory and context management in action with simple examples.

### Setup

First, install dependencies and configure your environment:

python

```python
%%capture
# Install required packages
# Option 1: From requirements.txt
# %pip install -q -r requirements.txt
 
# Option 2: Direct install
%pip install -q anthropic python-dotenv ipykernel
```

**⚠️ Important**: Create a `.env` file in this directory:

```bash
# Copy .env.example to .env and add your API key
cp .env.example .env
```

Then edit `.env` to add your Anthropic API key from [https://console.anthropic.com/](https://console.anthropic.com/)

python

```python
import os
from typing import cast
 
from anthropic import Anthropic
from dotenv import load_dotenv
 
# Load environment variables
load_dotenv()
 
# Model configuration - use alias for automatic updates
MODEL = "claude-sonnet-4-6"  # Can override via ANTHROPIC_MODEL env var
if os.getenv("ANTHROPIC_MODEL"):
    MODEL = os.getenv("ANTHROPIC_MODEL")
 
if not API_KEY:
    raise ValueError("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY not found. Copy .env.example to .env and add your API key.")
 
if not MODEL:
    raise ValueError("ANTHROPIC_MODEL not found. Copy .env.example to .env and set the model.")
 
MODEL = cast(str, MODEL)
 
client = Anthropic(api_key=API_KEY)
 
print("✓ API key loaded")
print(f"✓ Using model: {MODEL}")
```

```
✓ API key loaded
✓ Using model: claude-sonnet-4-6
```

### Example 1: Basic Memory Usage

Let's see Claude use memory to store information for future reference.

**Helper Functions**

These examples use helper functions from `demo_helpers.py`:

- **`run_conversation_loop()`**: Handles the API conversation loop
	- Calls Claude's API with memory tool enabled
		- Executes tool uses (memory operations)
		- Continues until Claude stops using tools
		- Returns the final response
- **`run_conversation_turn()`**: Single turn (used in Example 3)
	- Same as above but returns after one API call
		- Useful when you need fine-grained control
- **`print_context_management_info()`**: Displays context clearing stats
	- Shows tokens saved, tool uses cleared
		- Helps visualize when context editing triggers

**⚠️ Note on Memory Clearing**

The following cell clears all memory files to provide a clean slate for this demonstration. This is useful for running the notebook multiple times to see consistent results.

**In production applications**, you should carefully consider whether to clear all memory, as it permanently removes learned patterns. Consider using selective deletion or organizing memory into project-specific directories instead.

python

```python
# Import helper functions
from memory_demo.demo_helpers import (
    run_conversation_loop,
    run_conversation_turn,
    print_context_management_info,
)
from memory_tool import MemoryToolHandler
 
# Initialize
client = Anthropic()
memory = MemoryToolHandler(base_path="./demo_memory")
 
# Clear any existing memories to start fresh
print("🧹 Clearing previous memories...")
memory.clear_all_memory()
print("✓ Memory cleared\n")
 
# Load example code with a race condition bug
with open("memory_demo/sample_code/web_scraper_v1.py", "r") as f:
    code_to_review = f.read()
 
messages = [
    {
        "role": "user",
        "content": f"I'm reviewing a multi-threaded web scraper that sometimes returns fewer results than expected. The count is inconsistent across runs. Can you find the issue?\n\n\`\`\`python\n{code_to_review}\n\`\`\`",
    }
]
 
print("=" * 60)
print("📝 SESSION 1: Learning from a bug")
print("=" * 60)
 
# Run conversation loop
response = run_conversation_loop(
    client=client,
    model=MODEL,
    messages=messages,
    memory_handler=memory,
    system="You are a code reviewer.",
    max_tokens=2048,
    max_turns=5,
    verbose=True,
)
 
print("\n" + "=" * 60)
print("✅ Session 1 complete!")
print("=" * 60)
```

```

💬 Claude: ## Code Review: Multi-threaded Web Scraper Race Condition

### 🔴 **Critical Issue Found: Race Condition in Shared State**

You've correctly identified the problem! The code has **race conditions** caused by multiple threads modifying shared lists without synchronization.

---

### **The Problem**

**Lines with race conditions:**
\`\`\`python
self.results.append(result)  # RACE CONDITION
\`\`\`

**Problem:** 
- Python's \`list.append()\` is **NOT thread-safe** for concurrent modifications
- Multiple threads simultaneously appending can cause:
  - **Lost updates:** One thread's append overwrites another's
  - **Inconsistent state:** Internal list structure can be corrupted
  - **Unpredictable counts:** Results randomly dropped

**Why it happens:**
\`list.append()\` involves multiple operations:
1. Read current list size
2. Allocate space
3. Insert item
4. Update size

# In scrape_urls():
if "error" in result:
    self.failed_urls.append(result["url"])  # ⚠️ NOT THREAD-SAFE
else:
    self.results.append(result)  # ⚠️ NOT THREAD-SAFE
\`\`\`

**Why this causes lost results:**
- Python's \`list.append()\` is **not atomic** in all scenarios
- When multiple threads call \`append()\` simultaneously, the internal list operations can interleave
- This can cause lost updates where one thread's append overwrites another's

---

### **Solutions**

#### **Option 1: Use Thread Locks (Traditional approach)**
\`\`\`python
import threading

class WebScraper:
    """Web scraper that fetches multiple URLs concurrently."""

    def __init__(self, max_workers: int = 10):
        self.max_workers = max_workers
        self.results = []
        self.failed_urls = []
        self.lock = threading.Lock()  # ✅ Add lock

    def scrape_urls(self, urls: List[str]) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
        with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=self.max_workers) as executor:
            futures = [executor.submit(self.fetch_url, url) for url in urls]

            for future in as_completed(futures):
                result = future.result()

                # ✅ Protect shared state with lock
                with self.lock:
                    if "error" in result:
                        self.failed_urls.append(result["url"])
                    else:
                        self.results.append(result)

        return self.results
\`\`\`

#### **Option 2: Use Thread-Safe Collections**
\`\`\`python
from queue import Queue

class WebScraper:
    """Web scraper that fetches multiple URLs concurrently."""

    def __init__(self, max_workers: int = 10):
        self.max_workers = max_workers
        self.results = Queue()  # ✅ Thread-safe
        self.failed_urls = Queue()  # ✅ Thread-safe

    def scrape_urls(self, urls: List[str]) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
        with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=self.max_workers) as executor:
            futures = [executor.submit(self.fetch_url, url) for url in urls]

            for future in as_completed(futures):
                result = future.result()

                if "error" in result:
                    self.failed_urls.put(result["url"])
                else:
                    self.results.put(result)

        # Convert Queue to list for return
        return list(self.results.queue)
\`\`\`

#### **Option 3: Collect Results from Futures (Best approach)**
\`\`\`python
def scrape_urls(self, urls: List[str]) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
    """
    ✅ FIXED: Collect results in main thread, avoiding shared state.
    """
    results = []  # Local to main thread
    failed_urls = []  # Local to main thread
    
    with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=self.max_workers) as executor:
        futures = [executor.submit(self.fetch_url, url) for url in urls]

        for future in as_completed(futures):
            result = future.result()

            # ✅ Only main thread accesses these lists
            if "error" in result:
                failed_urls.append(result["url"])
            else:
                results.append(result)

    # Update instance variables once, in main thread
    self.results = results
    self.failed_urls = failed_urls
    
    return self.results

---

### **Summary**

- **Root cause**: Multiple threads appending to shared lists (\`self.results\` and \`self.failed_urls\`) without synchronization
- **Impact**: Lost updates leading to inconsistent result counts
- **Best fix**: Collect results in local variables within the main thread, then update instance variables once
- **Why this works**: Only one thread (main) accesses the result lists, eliminating the race condition entirely

The key insight: **Avoid shared mutable state in concurrent code**. Let worker threads return values and collect them in the coordinating thread.

**What happened?**

1. Claude checked its memory (empty on first run)
2. Identified the bug: **race condition** - multiple threads modifying shared state (`self.results` and `self.failed_urls`) without synchronization
3. Stored the concurrency pattern in memory for future reference

Now let's see the magic - Claude applying this learned pattern in a **new conversation**:

### Example 2: Cross-Conversation Learning

Start a completely new conversation - memory persists!

💬 Claude: ## Code Review: Async API Client

### Summary
This code has **concurrency issues** related to shared mutable state being accessed from multiple coroutines without proper synchronization. While the author correctly identifies these as bugs in comments, let me provide a comprehensive review.

However, the actual race condition risk here is **somewhat overstated** because:
- List \`.append()\` is atomic in CPython
- The \`+=\` operation on integers is also atomic
- Coroutines only switch at \`await\` points, and there are none between the operations

**BUT** this is still problematic because:
- It relies on CPython implementation details
- It's not guaranteed by the language specification
- The code is not portable to other Python implementations
- Future refactoring could introduce \`await\` points that cause real races

#### 1. **Race Condition on \`self.error_count\` (Line 51)**
\`\`\`python
self.error_count += 1  # Not atomic!
\`\`\`

**Problem**: Even in async code, this operation is not atomic. While asyncio is single-threaded, the \`+=\` operator involves:
1. Read current value
2. Add 1
3. Write back

An \`await\` in another coroutine between steps 1-3 can cause lost updates.

**Impact**: Error count will be incorrect/underreported.

#### 2. **Unsafe List Append on \`self.responses\` (Line 53)**
\`\`\`python
self.responses.append(result)  # Not thread-safe in async context!
\`\`\`

**Problem**: While \`list.append()\` is technically atomic in CPython due to GIL, this is:
- An implementation detail, not guaranteed by the language spec
- Bad practice that makes the code fragile
- Still problematic because the list is being modified while potentially being read elsewhere

**Impact**: Potential data corruption, missing responses, or incorrect counts.

#### 3. **Logic Error: Errors Not Included in Results**
\`\`\`python
if "error" in result:
    self.error_count += 1  # Counted but not stored!
else:
    self.responses.append(result)  # Only successes stored
\`\`\`

**Problem**: Failed requests increment \`error_count\` but are **never added to \`self.responses\`**. This means:
- The return value of \`fetch_all()\` only contains successful responses
- Error details are lost
- The summary calculation is inconsistent

---

### ⚠️ **Design Issues**

#### 4. **Stateful Class Design is Anti-Pattern for Concurrent Operations**
The class maintains mutable state (\`responses\`, \`error_count\`) that's modified during concurrent operations. This is problematic because:
- Makes the client non-reusable (calling \`fetch_all()\` twice will mix results)
- Harder to reason about state consistency
- Requires manual reset between calls

**Better approach**: Return data directly rather than accumulating in instance variables.

#### 5. **Inconsistent Error Handling**
Errors are caught and converted to dictionaries, but then handled differently from successes. This makes the API inconsistent and loses valuable error information.

---

### 🟡 **Minor Issues**

#### 6. **Missing Type Hints**
The module imports \`Optional\` but never uses it. The return types could be more specific.

#### 7. **Hardcoded Test Data in Main**
The \`* 20\` multiplier and specific endpoints make testing less flexible.

**Fix:** Use \`asyncio.gather()\` which is simpler and more idiomatic for this use case.

### 5. **Missing HTTP Status Code Validation**
**Location:** \`fetch_endpoint()\` method

### **Key Improvements in Fixed Version:**

1. ✅ **No shared mutable state** - Results returned directly
2. ✅ **All results captured** - Both successes and errors included
3. ✅ **Type-safe with dataclass** - Clear structure for results
4. ✅ **Reusable client** - Can call \`fetch_all()\` multiple times safely
5. ✅ **Consistent error handling** - All results have same structure
6. ✅ **Simpler concurrency** - Uses \`asyncio.gather()\` instead of \`as_completed()\`
7. ✅ **Static summary method** - Takes results as parameter, no state dependency

---

### **Alternative: If You Need Shared State**

If you absolutely need to accumulate results in the instance (e.g., for streaming/progressive updates), use an \`asyncio.Lock\`:

\`\`\`python
import asyncio

class AsyncAPIClient:
    def __init__(self, base_url: str):
        self.base_url = base_url
        self.responses = []
        self.error_count = 0
        self._lock = asyncio.Lock()  # Add lock

    async def fetch_all(self, endpoints: List[str]) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
        async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
            tasks = [self.fetch_endpoint(session, endpoint) for endpoint in endpoints]
            
            for coro in asyncio.as_completed(tasks):
                result = await coro
                
                # Protect shared state with lock
                async with self._lock:
                    if "error" in result:
                        self.error_count += 1
                    else:
                        self.responses.append(result)
        
        return self.responses
\`\`\`

However, the stateless design I showed first is **strongly preferred** for async code.

import asyncio
from typing import List, Dict, Any, TypedDict

### **Testing Recommendation**

Add tests that verify all 120 requests are accounted for:

\`\`\`python
async def test_all_results_captured():
    client = AsyncAPIClient("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com")
    endpoints = ["posts/1"] * 100
    results = await client.fetch_all(endpoints)
    assert len(results) == 100, f"Expected 100, got {len(results)}"
\`\`\`

============================================================
✅ Session 2 complete!
============================================================
```

**Notice the difference:**

- Claude **immediately checked memory** and found the thread-safety/concurrency pattern
- Recognized the similar issue in async code **instantly** without re-learning
- Response was **faster** because it applied stored knowledge about shared mutable state

This is **cross-conversation learning** in action!

### Example 3: Context Clearing While Preserving Memory

What happens during a **long review session** with many code files?

- Context fills up with tool results from previous reviews
- But memory (learned patterns) must persist!

Let's trigger **context editing** to see how Claude manages this automatically.

**Note on configuration:** We use `clear_at_least: 50` tokens because memory tool operations have small results (~50-150 tokens each). In production with larger tool results (like web search or code execution), you'd use higher values like 3000-5000 tokens.

python

```python
# Configure context management with BOTH clearing strategies
# Low thresholds for demo - in production use 30-40k tokens
CONTEXT_MANAGEMENT = {
    "edits": [
        # Thinking management MUST come first when combining strategies
        {
            "type": "clear_thinking_20251015",
            "keep": {"type": "thinking_turns", "value": 1}  # Keep only last turn's thinking

        }
    ]
}

============================================================
```

**What just happened?**

As context grew during multiple reviews with extended thinking enabled, context editing was applied:

1. **Thinking blocks cleared** - Old thinking from previous turns removed first
2. **Tool results cleared** - Old memory tool results removed when threshold exceeded
3. **Memory files intact** - Claude can still query learned patterns
4. **Token usage managed** - Saved tokens from both thinking and tool results

This demonstrates the key benefit:

- **Short-term memory** (conversation context + thinking) → Cleared to save space
- **Long-term memory** (stored patterns) → Persists across sessions

Let's verify memory survived the clearing:

python

```python
# Verify memory persists after context clearing
import os
 
print("📂 Memory files in demo_memory/:")
print()
 
for root, dirs, files in os.walk("./demo_memory"):
    # Calculate relative path for display
    level = root.replace("./demo_memory", "").count(os.sep)
    indent = "  " * level
    folder_name = os.path.basename(root) or "demo_memory"
    print(f"{indent}{folder_name}/")
 
    sub_indent = "  " * (level + 1)
    for file in files:
        file_path = os.path.join(root, file)
        size = os.path.getsize(file_path)
        print(f"{sub_indent}├── {file} ({size} bytes)")
 
print()
print("✅ All learned patterns preserved despite context clearing!")
```

```
📂 Memory files in demo_memory/:

demo_memory/
  memories/
    ├── review.md (318 bytes)

✅ All learned patterns preserved despite context clearing!
```

## 4\. How It Works

### Memory Tool Architecture

The memory tool is **client-side** - you control the storage. Claude makes tool calls, your application executes them.

#### Memory Tool Commands

| Command | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `view` | Show directory or file contents | `{"command": "view", "path": "/memories"}` |
| `create` | Create or overwrite a file | `{"command": "create", "path": "/memories/notes.md", "file_text": "..."}` |
| `str_replace` | Replace text in a file | `{"command": "str_replace", "path": "...", "old_str": "...", "new_str": "..."}` |
| `insert` | Insert text at line number | `{"command": "insert", "path": "...", "insert_line": 2, "insert_text": "..."}` |
| `delete` | Delete a file or directory | `{"command": "delete", "path": "/memories/old.txt"}` |
| `rename` | Rename or move a file | `{"command": "rename", "old_path": "...", "new_path": "..."}` |

See `memory_tool.py` for the complete implementation with path validation and security measures.

### Thinking Management (clear\_thinking\_20251015)

When using extended thinking, thinking blocks accumulate and consume tokens. The `clear_thinking` strategy manages these automatically.

**Important**: This strategy requires `thinking` to be enabled in your API call.

**API Call Pattern** (with extended thinking enabled):

```python
response = client.beta.messages.create(
    betas=["context-management-2025-06-27"],  # Required beta flag
    model="claude-sonnet-4-6",
    messages=messages,
    tools=[{"type": "memory_20250818", "name": "memory"}],
    thinking={"type": "enabled", "budget_tokens": 10000},  # Enable thinking
    context_management={  # Context editing config
        "edits": [
            {
                "type": "clear_thinking_20251015",
                "keep": {"type": "thinking_turns", "value": 1}  # Keep last turn only
            },
            {
                "type": "clear_tool_uses_20250919",
                "trigger": {"type": "input_tokens", "value": 35000},
                "keep": {"type": "tool_uses", "value": 5}
            }
        ]
    },
    max_tokens=2048
)
```

**Key points:**

- `clear_thinking` must come **first** when combining strategies
- Requires extended thinking to be enabled (`thinking={"type": "enabled", ...}`)
- Use `"keep": "all"` to preserve all thinking blocks for maximum cache hits
- Trigger is optional for thinking (clears based on `keep` value)

### Understanding the Demo Code

Key implementation details from `code_review_demo.py`:

```python
class CodeReviewAssistant:
    def __init__(self, memory_storage_path="./memory_storage"):
        self.client = Anthropic()
        self.memory_handler = MemoryToolHandler(base_path=memory_storage_path)
        self.messages = []
    
    def review_code(self, code, filename, description=""):
        # 1. Add user message
        self.messages.append({...})
        
        # 2. Conversation loop with tool execution
        while True:
            response = self.client.beta.messages.create(
                model=MODEL,
                system=self._create_system_prompt(),
                messages=self.messages,
                tools=[{"type": "memory_20250818", "name": "memory"}],
                betas=["context-management-2025-06-27"],
                context_management=CONTEXT_MANAGEMENT
            )
            
            # 3. Execute tool uses
            tool_results = []
            for content in response.content:
                if content.type == "tool_use":
                    result = self._execute_tool_use(content)
                    tool_results.append({...})
            
            # 4. Continue if there are tool uses, otherwise done
            if tool_results:
                self.messages.append({"role": "user", "content": tool_results})
            else:
                break
```

**The key pattern**: Keep calling the API while there are tool uses, executing them and feeding results back.

### What Claude Actually Learns

This is what makes memory powerful - **semantic pattern recognition**, not just syntax:

**Session 1: Thread-Based Web Scraper**

```python
# Bug: Race condition
class WebScraper:
    def __init__(self):
        self.results = []  # Shared state!
    
    def scrape_urls(self, urls):
        with ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:
            for future in as_completed(futures):
                self.results.append(future.result())  # RACE!
```

**What Claude Stores in Memory** (example file: `/memories/concurrency_patterns/thread_safety.md`):

When Claude encounters this pattern, it stores the following insights to its memory files:

- **Symptom**: Inconsistent results in concurrent operations
- **Cause**: Shared mutable state (lists/dicts) modified from multiple threads
- **Solution**: Use locks, thread-safe data structures, or return results instead
- **Red flags**: Instance variables in thread callbacks, unused locks, counter increments

---

**Session 2: Async API Client** (New conversation!)

Claude checks memory FIRST, finds the thread-safety pattern, then:

1. **Recognizes** similar pattern in async code (coroutines can interleave too)
2. **Applies** the solution immediately (no re-learning needed)
3. **Explains** with reference to stored knowledge
```python
# Claude spots this immediately:
async def fetch_all(self, endpoints):
    for coro in asyncio.as_completed(tasks):
        self.responses.append(await coro)  # Same pattern!
```

---

**Why This Matters:**

- ❌ **Syntax checkers** miss race conditions entirely
- ✅ **Claude learns** architectural patterns and applies them across contexts
- ✅ **Cross-language**: Pattern applies to Go, Java, Rust concurrency too
- ✅ **Gets better**: Each review adds to the knowledge base

### Sample Code Files

The demo uses these sample files (all have concurrency/thread-safety bugs):

- `memory_demo/sample_code/web_scraper_v1.py` - Race condition: threads modifying shared state
- `memory_demo/sample_code/api_client_v1.py` - Similar concurrency bug in async context
- `memory_demo/sample_code/data_processor_v1.py` - Multiple concurrency issues for long session demo

Let's look at one:

**`memory_demo/sample_code/web_scraper_v1.py`**

```python
"""
Concurrent web scraper with a race condition bug.
Multiple threads modify shared state without synchronization.
"""
 
import time
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor, as_completed
from typing import List, Dict
 
import requests
 
class WebScraper:
    """Web scraper that fetches multiple URLs concurrently."""
 
    def __init__(self, max_workers: int = 10):
        self.max_workers = max_workers
        self.results = []  # BUG: Shared mutable state accessed by multiple threads!
        self.failed_urls = []  # BUG: Another race condition!
 
    def fetch_url(self, url: str) -> Dict[str, any]:
        """Fetch a single URL and return the result."""
        try:
            response = requests.get(url, timeout=5)
            response.raise_for_status()
            return {
                "url": url,
                "status": response.status_code,
                "content_length": len(response.content),
            }
        except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
            return {"url": url, "error": str(e)}
 
    def scrape_urls(self, urls: List[str]) -> List[Dict[str, any]]:
        """
        Scrape multiple URLs concurrently.
 
        BUG: self.results is accessed from multiple threads without locking!
        This causes race conditions where results can be lost or corrupted.
        """
        with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=self.max_workers) as executor:
            futures = [executor.submit(self.fetch_url, url) for url in urls]
 
            for future in as_completed(futures):
                result = future.result()
 
                # RACE CONDITION: Multiple threads append to self.results simultaneously
                if "error" in result:
                    self.failed_urls.append(result["url"])  # RACE CONDITION
                else:
                    self.results.append(result)  # RACE CONDITION
 
        return self.results
```

**Bug**: Multiple threads modify `self.results` and `self.failed_urls` without locking!

Claude will:

1. Identify the race conditions
2. Store the pattern in `/memories/concurrency_patterns/thread_safety.md`
3. Apply this concurrency pattern to async code in Session 2

### Demo Overview

We've built a complete Code Review Assistant. The implementation is in `memory_demo/code_review_demo.py`.

**To run the interactive demo:**

```bash
python memory_demo/code_review_demo.py
```

The demo demonstrates:

1. **Session 1**: Review Python code with a bug → Claude learns the pattern
2. **Session 2**: Review similar code (new conversation) → Claude applies the pattern
3. **Session 3**: Long review session → Context editing keeps it manageable

## 7\. Best Practices & Security

### Memory Management

**Do:**

- ✅ Store task-relevant patterns, not conversation history
- ✅ Organize with clear directory structure
- ✅ Use descriptive file names
- ✅ Periodically review and clean up memory

**Don't:**

- ❌ Store sensitive information (passwords, API keys, PII)
- ❌ Let memory grow unbounded
- ❌ Store everything indiscriminately

### Security: Path Traversal Protection

**Critical**: Always validate paths to prevent directory traversal attacks. See `memory_tool.py` for implementation.

### Security: Memory Poisoning

**⚠️ Critical Risk**: Memory files are read back into Claude's context, making them a potential vector for prompt injection.

**Mitigation strategies:**

1. **Content Sanitization**: Filter dangerous patterns before storing
2. **Memory Scope Isolation**: Per-user/per-project isolation
3. **Memory Auditing**: Log and scan all memory operations
4. **Prompt Engineering**: Instruct Claude to ignore instructions in memory

See `memory_tool.py` for complete security implementation and tests in `tests/`.

## Conclusion

### What You Accomplished

In this cookbook, you learned to:

- ✅ **Implement the memory tool** for cross-conversation learning (Sessions 1 & 2 showed pattern recognition persisting)
- ✅ **Configure context editing** with token triggers and retention policies (Session 3 demonstrated automatic clearing)
- ✅ **Apply security best practices** including path validation and memory poisoning prevention

### Applying These Patterns

**For your projects:**

1. Start with a single memory file for patterns (e.g., `/memories/patterns.md`)
2. Set context editing triggers at 30-40k tokens for production use
3. Implement per-project memory isolation to prevent cross-contamination

**Other applications:**

- **Customer support**: Store user preferences and common issue resolutions
- **Research assistants**: Accumulate domain knowledge across sessions
- **Data analysis**: Remember dataset characteristics and successful techniques
- **Production deployment**: Use [claude-code-action](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-action) for GitHub PR reviews
- **Security hardening**: Review the memory poisoning mitigations in `memory_tool.py`
- **Extended thinking**: Explore thinking management for compute-intensive tasks
